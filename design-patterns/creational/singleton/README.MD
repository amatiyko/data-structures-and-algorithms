The **Singleton** pattern is thus known because it restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. 

Classically, the Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.
