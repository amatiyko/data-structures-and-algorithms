**Creational** design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

Some of the patterns that fall under this category are: _Constructor_, _Factory_, _Abstract_, _Prototype_, _Singleton_ and _Builder_.
